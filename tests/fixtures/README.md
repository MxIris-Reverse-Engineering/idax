# Test Fixture Catalog

## Primary Fixture

### `simple_appcall_linux64`

- **Format**: ELF64 (x86-64, Linux)
- **Source**: Simple C program compiled with GCC, statically or dynamically linked
- **Used by**: All integration tests (smoke, behavior, decode, mutation, roundtrip, etc.); C++ runtime tests copy and analyze the raw binary with the current IDA release
- **Pre-analysed IDB**: `simple_appcall_linux64.i64` is retained for consumers that explicitly require an existing database (identity/license metadata sanitized with `scripts/sanitize_ida_fixture.py`; enforced by the repository byte-level privacy gate)
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Contains `main()` and several helper functions
  - Has code, data, BSS, and read-only segments
  - ELF magic `\x7fELF` at offset 0
  - Contains relocations and string literals
  - Suitable for decompiler testing (Hex-Rays)
  - Contains enough complexity for xref, comment, name, type, and fixup tests

### `register_tracking_aarch64`

- **Used by**: Opaque register-value tracking integration test
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Defines deterministic `x29 = 0` and high-bit-distinct `x0`/`w0` values
  - Applies a deterministic `-32 B` stack-pointer delta before a call
  - Merges `x2 = 0x11` and `x2 = 0x22` across two control-flow paths

## Scenario Fixture Directories

### `loader/`

Reserved for loader-specific test fixtures. Future fixtures:
- Custom binary format samples for accept/load/save testing
- Archive members for multi-file loader scenarios
- Minimal flat binaries for edge-case load tests

### `procmod/`

Reserved for processor module test fixtures. Future fixtures:
- Custom instruction set binaries (synthetic ISAs)
- Binaries requiring custom register definitions
- Switch table edge cases for switch detection validation

### `decompiler_debugger/`

Reserved for decompiler and debugger scenario fixtures. Future fixtures:
- Binaries with complex control flow for ctree visitor testing
- Optimized binaries for variable tracking edge cases
- Binaries with debug info for debugger event testing

## Adding New Fixtures

1. Place the binary in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Update this README with format, source, and key characteristics
3. If the fixture requires pre-analysis, document the IDA version used
4. Ensure the fixture is committed to git (binary files, use git-lfs if large)
