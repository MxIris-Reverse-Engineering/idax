# IDAX Python API reference

Import domains from the package root (`from idax import database, function`) or
from their stable module paths. Exact callable overloads, properties, callback
protocols, and enum members are defined by the shipped `.pyi` files and are
checked with strict mypy.

Shared modules:

- `idax.core`: `BAD_ADDRESS`, address ranges, search/demangle options, and
  processor identifiers/profiles.
- `idax.error`: `IdaxError`, category-specific subclasses, `Error`, and
  `ErrorCategory`.

## Resource and callback rules

- Use resources such as scoped subscriptions, hotkeys, decompiled functions,
  wait boxes, choosers, and timers as context managers where available.
- Explicitly unregister global callbacks before unloading the owning Python
  extension or plugin.
- Do not retain callback-scoped contexts for later use; checked access raises
  `ConflictError` after callback return.
- Do not close a database while decompiler-owned results remain live.
- External idalib code must call IDAX from its initializing process thread.

## Authoring boundaries

Python can subclass `plugin.Plugin`, `loader.Loader`, `processor.Processor`,
`debugger.AppcallExecutor`, `decompiler.MicrocodeFilter`, graph viewer
interfaces, and UI chooser/viewer interfaces. Native registrations retain the
Python instance until deterministic teardown.

The C++ `IDAX_PLUGIN`, `IDAX_LOADER`, and `IDAX_PROCESSOR` macros create binary
entry points at compile time and therefore have no runtime Python equivalent.
Python-hosted authoring uses the exposed classes and registration functions;
shipping a standalone native IDA binary entry point remains a C++ packaging
operation.

## Optional capabilities

Debugger backends, Lumina service access, Hex-Rays decompilers, GUI widgets,
clipboard backends, and modal dialogs depend on the installed IDA product,
license, process mode, and host environment. Capability queries return the
observed state; absence does not authorize an ABI fallback.
