# IDAX Python tutorial

## 1. Choose the runtime owner

In IDAPython, IDA owns initialization and the current database. Import IDAX and
start with domain calls. In an external process, initialize once and keep all
IDAX calls on that same thread:

```python
from idax import database

database.init(
    ["idax-analysis"],
    database.RuntimeOptions(
        quiet=True,
        plugin_policy=database.PluginLoadPolicy(disable_user_plugins=True),
    ),
)
```

Use a context manager for the database-open interval:

```python
with database.opened("sample.bin", save_on_exit=False):
    print(database.processor_profile())
```

## 2. Traverse concepts, not SDK headers

```python
from idax import function, instruction, xref

for current in function.all():
    print(f"{current.start:#x}: {current.name}")
    for address in function.item_addresses(current.start):
        decoded = instruction.decode(address)
        references = xref.refs_from(address)
        print(address, decoded.mnemonic, len(references))
```

Ranges are iterable and snapshots are copied values. You do not manage SDK
containers or native memory.

## 3. Mutate transactionally

```python
from idax import comment, data

address = 0x401000
original = data.read_byte(address)
try:
    comment.set(address, "temporary probe")
    data.patch_byte(address, original ^ 0xFF)
    assert data.original_byte(address) == original
finally:
    data.revert_patch(address)
    comment.remove(address)
```

IDAX raises structured exceptions on failed operations; use `try/finally` or a
resource context manager for every mutation that requires rollback.

## 4. Decompile with deterministic ownership

```python
from idax import decompiler

if decompiler.available():
    with decompiler.decompile(0x401000) as result:
        print(result.declaration())
        print(result.pseudocode())
```

Hex-Rays availability includes license and extension-ABI compatibility. A
false result is a capability boundary. Never retain ctree or microcode callback
views after their callback and release decompiled results before database close.

## 5. Subscribe and unregister

```python
from idax import event

def renamed(address: int, old_name: str, new_name: str) -> None:
    print(address, old_name, new_name)

with event.ScopedSubscription(event.on_renamed(renamed)):
    run_operation_that_may_rename_items()
```

The binding acquires the GIL for callbacks and keeps `renamed` alive until the
subscription closes. Exceptions are contained at the native callback boundary.

## 6. Register a UI action

```python
from idax import plugin

action = plugin.Action()
action.id = "example:idax:summary"
action.label = "Print IDAX summary"
action.handler = lambda: print("IDAX action invoked")
action.enabled = lambda: True

plugin.register_action(action)
try:
    run_interactive_workflow()
finally:
    plugin.unregister_action(action.id)
```

Actions, hotkeys, timers, choosers, and viewers must be unregistered or closed
before their owning Python module is unloaded.

## 7. Implement an extension interface

```python
from idax import processor

class MinimalProcessor(processor.Processor):
    def info(self) -> processor.ProcessorInfo:
        return processor.ProcessorInfo()

    def analyze(self, address: int) -> int:
        return 0

    def emulate(self, address: int) -> processor.EmulateResult:
        return processor.EmulateResult.NOT_IMPLEMENTED

    def output_instruction(self, address: int) -> None:
        pass

    def output_operand(
        self, address: int, operand_index: int
    ) -> processor.OutputOperandResult:
        return processor.OutputOperandResult.NOT_IMPLEMENTED

    def output_instruction_with_context(
        self, address: int, output: processor.OutputContext
    ) -> processor.OutputInstructionResult:
        output.mnemonic("nop")
        return processor.OutputInstructionResult.SUCCESS
```

Loader and processor objects receive checked input/output/context adapters.
These adapters are not raw streams or pointers and borrowed instances expire
when native dispatch returns.

## 8. Make a named mutation undoable

```python
from idax import comment, undo

address = 0x401000
if undo.create_point("example.comment", "Set analysis comment"):
    comment.set(address, "reviewed")
    assert undo.undo_action_label() == "Set analysis comment"
    undo.perform_undo()
```

Create the restore point immediately before its mutation. `False` means that
the current host is not recording undo history; a missing next-action label is
returned as `None`.

## 9. Record a typed analysis problem

```python
from idax import problem

address = 0x401000
problem.remember(problem.Kind.ATTENTION, address, "Review indirect flow")
try:
    assert problem.contains(problem.Kind.ATTENTION, address)
    assert problem.description(problem.Kind.ATTENTION, address) == "Review indirect flow"
finally:
    problem.remove(problem.Kind.ATTENTION, address)
```

Descriptions and ordered lookups return `None` when absent. The problem kind
is a closed `IntEnum`; no raw SDK problem-list identifier crosses the binding.

## 10. Manage an address bookmark

```python
from idax import bookmark

created = bookmark.set(address, "Review indirect target")
try:
    assert bookmark.at(address) is not None
    assert bookmark.at_slot(created.slot) is not None
    bookmark.set(address, "Validated indirect target")
finally:
    bookmark.remove_slot(created.slot)
```

New bookmarks use the lowest free slot unless an explicit slot is supplied.
Snapshots own their address, exact slot, and description; removal preserves the
slots of every survivor.

## 11. Round-trip exception metadata

```python
from idax import address, exception

metadata = exception.HandlerMetadata()
metadata.regions = [address.Range(0x401020, 0x401028)]
selector = exception.CatchSelector()
selector.kind = exception.CatchSelectorKind.CATCH_ALL
handler = exception.CatchHandler()
handler.metadata = metadata
handler.selector = selector
handlers = exception.CppHandlers()
handlers.catches = [handler]
definition = exception.BlockDefinition()
definition.protected_regions = [address.Range(0x401000, 0x401010)]
definition.handlers = handlers
exception.add(definition)
```

Ranges are copied half-open values. `list()` returns the host-calculated nesting
level; `contains()` accepts semantic `Location` values or a sequence of them.
`system_region_start()` is an independent optional host query and may return
`None` for an ordinary stored SEH block.

## 12. Parse source declarations with an installed parser

```python
from idax import parser

parser.select_for([parser.Language.C, parser.Language.CPP])
selected = parser.selected_name()
report = parser.parse_for(
    parser.Language.CPP,
    "struct packet_header { unsigned size; };",
)
assert report.ok
```

The parsed declaration is stored in the current local type library. A nonzero
`error_count` reports source diagnostics without converting them into an IDAX
transport error. Parser names, argument support, and option keys depend on the
installed parser; handle `NotFoundError` and `UnsupportedError` explicitly.

## 13. Organize a built-in directory tree

```python
from idax import directory

tree = directory.Tree.open(directory.Kind.FUNCTIONS)
tree.create_directory("/reviewed")
functions = [entry.path for entry in tree.find_items("*")[:2]]
report = tree.move(functions, "/reviewed")
for failure in report.failures:
    print(failure.input_index, failure.path, failure.error)
```

`Tree` stores only the closed standard-tree kind; every entry and report is an
owned snapshot. Bulk operations preserve partial success, and each failure
retains the original caller index. Full names and paths are identities;
display names can collide. Folded directory names can contain the host's
non-path separator byte and must not be rewritten before later tree calls.

## 14. Persist scoped plugin configuration

```python
from idax import registry

store = registry.Store.open("plugins\\example")
store.write_string("profile", "default")
store.write_binary("signature", b"\x7fELF")
store.write_integer("limit", 32)
store.write_boolean("enabled", True)

update = registry.StringListUpdate()
update.add = "recent.bin"
update.max_records = 20
store.update_string_list(update)
```

`Store` owns only its nonempty key text; reads and inventories return copied
values. Missing typed values return `None`, while reading an existing value
through the wrong typed method raises `ConflictError`. Compound list updates
are deterministic but not transactional across processes; serialize writers
that share a key. Use `erase_tree()` for explicit recursive cleanup of a
disposable subtree.

## 15. Track a register value

```python
from idax import registers

tracked = registers.track(0x401020, "x0")
if tracked.state is registers.TrackingState.CONSTANT:
    for candidate in tracked.candidates:
        print(candidate.constant, candidate.origin.address)
```

`constant_at()` and `stack_delta_at()` return `None` when the tracker is
supported but no unique value is known. `UnsupportedError` means the current
processor module does not implement this tracker. `nearest_at()` accepts two
distinct base registers; cache change notifications use the closed
`ReferenceMutation` enum rather than raw xref type values.

## 16. Diagnose failures

```python
from idax import IdaxError

try:
    run_analysis()
except IdaxError as error:
    print(error.category, error.code)
    print(error.message)
    print(error.context)
```

Use `TypeError`/`ValueError` handling only for Python argument conversion.
IDAX operation failures use the structured hierarchy.
