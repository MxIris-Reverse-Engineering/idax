# Swift binding contract

This package implements the current IDAX C++ domain model. `cpp_api_inventory.json` records declarations, overloads, enum cases, and fields from the authoritative headers. `value_schema.json` specifies the transport rules for generated value operations. Neither file by itself proves behavioral parity; dedicated adapters and executable clients cover ownership, callbacks, and operations absent from the shared C transport.

## Runtime and errors

Initialize `Runtime` once on the process main thread for an idalib program. A native add-on attaches to the existing host during module bootstrap. Subsequent SDK operations execute on that same operating-system thread; Swift actor isolation does not establish an operating-system thread identity. Foreign-thread access fails before SDK entry.

`IDAError` carries the exact native category, code, message, and context. The legacy C display message remains unchanged for existing consumers; separate additive accessors transport the unmodified message and context. Swift input strings reaching C-string interfaces reject embedded NUL. Output strings require valid UTF-8. IDC value strings use explicit byte lengths and preserve embedded NUL.

## Values, resources, and callbacks

Copied records, enums, arrays, and strings own their contents. Public record initializers support independent construction. Native resources are reference types without `Sendable` conformance. Explicit `copy()` creates an independent native value where the C++ model supports copying; assignment preserves ordinary Swift reference semantics.

Native resource holders validate both their owner thread and database lifetime. Opening or closing a database invalidates database-bound native resources in reverse acquisition order. Retained Swift objects remain closed after a later database opens. Explicit close is idempotent; ARC destruction on a foreign thread queues native release for the runtime thread. Database replacement is rejected until the current database is closed.

Lifecycle registration consumes a retained Swift callback context on native entry, including failure paths. Native callable ownership controls its final release. Borrowed callback views validate a lease on every operation and fail after callback return. Registration close and resource invalidation preserve an in-flight callback until its dispatch completes. Deferred action unregistration acceptance is distinct from completed native teardown.

## Packaging

SwiftPM uses stable Swift language mode 6 and declares macOS 13 as its deployment baseline. CMake builds the non-colliding `idax_swift_native` archive, including the canonical Rust C transport and private Swift adapters. A private system-library target consumes generated pkg-config metadata. The manifest contains no unsafe linker flags or experimental interop features. Executable clients supply an rpath to their actual licensed IDA runtime; source distributions do not contain the proprietary runtime, identity-bearing absolute host paths, or compiled local products.

Add-ons link one shared `IDAXShared` image for Swift classes and native runtime state. Each add-on separately owns its SDK descriptor and factory symbols; those factories use hidden visibility to prevent interposition between add-ons. The helper installs relative support-library search paths, and relocated multi-add-on host probes validate that layout.

Plugin, loader, and processor examples must produce real native `PLUGIN`, `LDSC`, and `LPH` exports and dispatch into protocol requirements implemented by Swift conformers. Object construction alone is not module-host evidence.

## Assumption register

| ID | Assumption | Stress test / falsification probe | Dependent result |
|---|---|---|---|
| SW.A1 | Current public headers and superseding decisions define the intended surface | Rebuild the declaration inventory; require a reviewed mapping for every declaration, field, and overload | Coverage claims |
| SW.A2 | Stable Swift 6 language constructs can meet the declared deployment envelope | Build with the minimum supported toolchain and deployment target; inspect public consumers and load commands | Platform availability |
| SW.A3 | All SDK operations use one initializing operating-system thread | Invoke initialization, ordinary calls, resource access, and ARC destruction from foreign threads | Thread confinement |
| SW.A4 | Closing/opening a database invalidates all database-bound native resources | Retain values over close/reopen and require deterministic rejection; record LIFO destructor order | Session safety |
| SW.A5 | Native callable lifetime owns each transferred callback context exactly once | Weak-capture tests for success, failure, self-unregister, automatic stop, and in-flight teardown | Callback ownership |
| SW.A6 | The actual SDK revision and runtime are IDA 9.4 | Compile against pinned revision `6929db6868a524496eb66e76e4ec6c9d720a0594`; execute isolated host fixtures | Native runtime results |
| SW.A7 | The C transport's documented status, allocation, and enum conventions match its implementation | Inspect each mapped conversion/free path; exercise false-valued successes, empty arrays, optional absence, and malformed inputs | Generated value adapters |

Bounded impacts: omitted overloads, lifetime errors, and broken native module dispatch **high**; package transitivity and semantic metadata loss **medium**. The generated value layer costs O(n) time and space for n copied records/bytes. With R retained native holders and Q queued finalizers, the owner-thread guard scans up to R holders; draining queued holder releases can cost O(R + QR), in addition to native destruction and callback work. Database invalidation can scan retained closed holders repeatedly, giving an O(R²) worst case. Individual holder-state access after these guards is O(1). Offsets explicitly identify bytes or bits, and wait configuration explicitly identifies milliseconds.

This contract is an acceptance specification. The [validation report](../../docs/reviews/swift-rewrite-validation.md) records Phase 72 evidence and status for declaration mapping, regression/runtime checks, packages, existing-language CI and privacy audits. The assumptions and host-evidence limits here continue to apply after implementation closure.

- **SW.A8 — synchronous native borrow boundaries.** SDK callbacks execute on the runtime owner thread within guarded native operations. Probe escaped ctree children, callback close/reopen, early Hex-Rays session closure, and ARC release during dispatch. Session and lease-dependent results require these probes; no runtime pass is inferred from source compilation.

- **SW.A9 — custom registration generations.** Type/format/fixup identities issued by this Swift bridge carry opaque generations. Probe explicit unregister followed by actual SDK slot reuse, stale queries/mutations, and old-owner close/ARC; require the replacement callback and metadata to survive. Arbitrary external SDK unregister/re-register with the same numeric slot and same name has no observable SDK generation signal. Detection of that external sequence is unknown; wrapper-mediated registration results depend on this boundary.
- **SW.A10 — one shared add-on support image per host.** All simultaneously loaded add-ons use the same built IDAXShared image, with separate hidden module factories. Probe a relocated plugin/loader/processor tree and two different plugins in one host; require independent callbacks, no duplicate Swift class diagnostics, and normal teardown. Mixing incompatible support-library builds is outside the validated package configuration.

- **SW.A11 — supported custom form grammar.** The pinned FORM_C grammar defines placeholder storage, field identifiers, directives and group argument order. Probe compatible scalar/text/path/dynamic-label storage, interleaved groups, buffer capacities, malformed markup, mismatched arguments, the 64-argument limit and -2/-1/0/1 outcomes. Nonmodal validation and controlled native-dispatch probes establish those paths; actual modal acceptance remains unknown on this host. Native callbacks/toolkit-pointer controls and nested substitutions inside field labels are not supported by the opaque argument model. Arbitrary Qt/toolkit embedding through native widget-host pointers is likewise outside the public Swift API; checked Widget operations are not asserted to replace that capability.

Custom form validation/preparation takes O(markup bytes + argument count + copied value bytes + requested character-buffer capacities) time and O(argument count + copied value bytes + requested character-buffer capacities) storage. Character capacities are byte counts; the default native command capacity is independent of the platform path capacity. SDK display complexity is unknown. Results -1 and 0 do not commit bindings; zero retains the SDK's ambiguity among No/cancellation/allocation/syntax outcomes. Results below -1 remain SDK failures.
